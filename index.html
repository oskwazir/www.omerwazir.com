            <p class="lead">I have been using React 0.13.0-beta.1 and just last night got Jest to run my tests. There was a warning while running my tests that `getDOMNode` is deprecated but I didn't know what to use instead. Some digging around the React repo on Github indicated I should be using `React.findDOMNode`.</p></a></li>

            <p class="lead">I ignored React for a while. I would see comments on reddit and hacker news of people loving the way React worked. I just didn’t care enough to make an effort and understand what React was all about. After watching the keynote at React Conf I realized that React is dog food and the idea of building views made of components was something I advocated at work for a long time. Now I’m taking the slow effort of understanding how to build stuff with React.</p></a></li>
