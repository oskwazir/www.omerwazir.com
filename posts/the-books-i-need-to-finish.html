				<h1 class="title">I need to finish these books</h1>
				<p class="date">May 8 2014</p>
				<p class="lead">I'm going to share with you the list of books I haven't finished reading. I'm hoping that by publically displaying my desired goal I'll stick with the plan. I won't buy any new books or change this list until all have been read.</p>
				<div class="article"><p>It&#39;s easy to buy a book but it&#39;s much harder for me to remember to finish reading it. I used to spend time after work reading literature and non-fiction but I never spent time with technical material. That changed in the past year since I started learning Javascript. Now I&#39;ve acquired quite a few books on JS and a couple other interesting books. I&#39;ll stick with one book at a time and will take notes of what I&#39;ve learned.</p>
<p><p class="h3">The Books I need to read</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Testable Javascript by Mark Ethan Trostler</li>
<li>CSS3 For Web Designers by Dan Cederholm</li>
<li>Javascript Allonge by Reginald Braithwaite</li>
<li>Mobile First by Luke Wroblewski</li>
<li>Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte</li>
<li>JavaScript Enlightenment by Cody Lindley</li>
<li>Understanding Computation by Tom Stuart</li>
<li>Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript by Michael McMillan</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m eager to finish Testable Javascript first. Becoming better at writing testable and maintainable code is a major goal for me. Understanding Computation and Javascript Allonge are two books I really want to read, but those are the books I need to take my time with. I started Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript and found some errors in the code which turned me off from the book. I submitted some errata for the book and I guess I can continue with the book just to find more bugs.</p>
