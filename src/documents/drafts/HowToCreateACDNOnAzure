###Creating a CDN on Azure
###Creating Blob Storage
* Explain how Storage can be of three different types. We will be using blob storage.
* List how I created my storage container. 
* Post pictures of the Azure portal.
####Containers
* Explain what a container is.
* Containers for different things makes organizing items easier.
    * I have a container for stylesheets and images

####Geo Storage is not a CDN
* Explain what Geo Storage is. It's data redundancy not load balancing.
###Create CDN Service
* Explain what the CDN does. Show how you can access a resource using the funky default URI
###Update DNS with CNAME for DNS
* Explain how the DNS name maps to the CDN URI by using the CNAME.
* Explain why the other DNS thing doesn't work. The A one whatever it is I forgot right now.
###Wait about an hour
* Takes a while for the nodes to have your resources.
* Share the link that shows the IP for a resource across the world.
