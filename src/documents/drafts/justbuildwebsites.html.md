##How I created the website for Ichiro Sushi

Greg Smith has an [article](http://bocoup.com/weblog/nom/) about his process for designing a website for a fictional restaurant. There's a lot to learn in what he does and I won't repeat it here, just read his article. A restaurant website is a pretty straight forward project and was something I had previously thought about building. So using what I've learned from Greg Smith's article I'm going to explain how I built the first website for Just Build Websites.

###Evaluating local restaurant websites

Before I start building out the website for Ichiro Sushi I want to look at three of my favorite restaurants in Tucson. I'll see what I like and what I don't like about the site as a customer. Usually when I visit a restaurant's webite I need to know the following:

* what their hours are
* the menu
* where they are located.

This information should be easily available from the landing page with prominent links to the menu or a map of the location. I don't know if an embedded map is really needed during the Age of Mobile Devices but maybe it is?

I <strong>do not</strong> want to see Flash,Quicktime,canvas or even Java. I want the site to load correctly and quickly on my iPhone. If the restaurant has multiple locations in a city I want to be able to see hours and and the address for each location in a list. I do not want to hear any music.

####Taco Giro

Location prominent on first page. Hours not prominent. Menu linked four times on home page. Menu not in a text format, it's an image of the physical menu. The site is wrapped in a canvas which might be the reason that accessibility tools don't work on it.



###A structured process for creating a website

In a normal business environment the order of actions consist of manager telling you to create a prototype from unrelated requirements to an expecation that your prototype is production ready. The order of actions below are taken from Greg's article. I've never seen information architecture as a process before. I've usually seen a direct jump from requirements to prototyping. Sometimes a designer is trying their best to create an elegant solution to the customers needs, but rarely have I seen anyone really appreciate the effort a designer puts in. Often people over estimate their abilities to design a UI and they think good UI/UX is only for other projects, not their text entry form application. That's the incorrect mindset to have. End of my rant.
