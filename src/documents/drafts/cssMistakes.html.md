> The problem with some CSS is that you can tell that it's written in the top-down style. It mimics the HTML layout rather than abstracting the design elements, often using ids for context, such as #header, #content. This usually results in long selectors (how many times have you seen .menu ul li a {} ?), and the code is going to be really rough to debug and do maintenance on. To fix this CSS, you'll need to work on abstracting design components from the page, which will also help you remove redundancy in your code.

After reading the article you will be checking your CSS.
