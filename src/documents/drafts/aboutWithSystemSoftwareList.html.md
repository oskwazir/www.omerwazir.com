##I'm Omer <small>(sounds like boomer without the “B” <span class="line-through">b</span>oomer)</small>

I'm a software developer in Tucson, Arizona. I can speak three languages - English, Urdu and Pashto. I can read and write in English and Urdu. I've lived in the USA and Pakistan.

###Favorite Applications

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) I do most of my work now in Sublime Text. I'm not a power user when it comes to text editors. The most power I get is from having Emmet installed and the ability to select and edit multiple things at once with `Ctrl-D`.
 * [Emmet](http://emmet.io/)
 * [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/)
* [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html)
* [Firefox Aurora](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/?WT.mc_id=fa10sn)

####Linux
* [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) Docker has made it really easy for me to install and run applications on Linux.

####Windows

* [Cmder](http://bliker.github.io/cmder/) Great looking command prompt. It's hard to find a command prompt for windows that looks as good ad Cmder.
* [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler)
 Fantastic for inspecting traffic and extremley useful if you can take the time to learn how to use it.
 * [Intruder21](http://yamagata.int21h.jp/tool/intruder21/) I came across this extension while going through a security course and it proved to be very useful for illustrating how easily an insecure connection can be manipulated.

####OS X
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html)

###Favorite NPM packages
* [Azure cli](https://www.npmjs.org/package/azure-cli)
* [docpad](https://www.npmjs.org/package/docpad)
* [gulp](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp)
* [grunt](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt)
* [nodeschool.io](http://http://nodeschool.io/)

###Chrome extensions

###Video Games

I'm a fan of the Broncos.
