##Hi! I'm Omer <small>(sounds like boomer without the “B” <span class="line-through">b</span>oomer)</small>

I'm a software developer in Tucson, Arizona. I like drinking coffee and work at a standing desk. I can speak three languages. I can read and write in two languages. At a very early age I learned how to walk backwards. I've lived in two different countries. I own a Macbook Pro that is almost eight years old. I will not buy a VW again. I really enjoyed War & Peace. I'm a fan of the Broncos.
