### My orignal answer

> You will probably have a higher chance of developing technical skills if you take some time to study and code during your free
> time. You shouldn't depend on your job to train you on new languages or frameworks. There are a lot of things you and I don't
> know and we won't have time to learn about them while at work.
> Also being a developer isn't just purely coding. There's the ability to write legible code, write tests, know what to use when, > know how to read code that you didn't write (or even in a language you aren't a master of), find the cause of a bug in an 
> efficient way. You need to be able to talk effectively to non-technical people to figure out why they think X is a bug or how Y > is really supposed to work. Those type of skills kinda evolve during your work hours but you have to be aware about improving   > on them.

> I think if you don't spend some extra time programming you very well might grow stale. Years will pass by and you'll realize
> you want to get a new job but you don't really know that much beyond what you did at work.
