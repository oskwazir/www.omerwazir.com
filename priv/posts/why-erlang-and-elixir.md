title: Why I am learning Erlang and Elixir
tags: ['elixir','erlang','learning']
intro: "Before the first Tucson Elixir meetup happens I wanted to take a moment to talk about why I started learning Erlang and Elixir, and take some time to describe how I'm learning both languages."

For a long time I really wondered how to build concurrent, distribute systems reliably. Whatever experience I had with threading in Java didn’t appear to fit naturally within the language. Meanwhile I wanted to learn a language that was functional and pragmatic. I wanted to experience a completely different approach to solving common problems so I could break out of a fixed mindset I felt like I got stuck in with JavaScript. 

	I don't remember how I discovered Erlang but after reading a few chapters of [Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com) by Fred Hébert I was completely commited to learning Erlang/OTP. It really felt like I discovered a way to build concurrent systems in a way that had been proven to work, and it didn’t require some insane sacrifices to an Engineering Warlock to accomplish.


## Not the JVM

* Wanted 100% full functional experience, concernced JVM functional languages would let Java slip in. Same with F#.

## Functional

What’s the big deal about functional programming?

## Concurrency

Had a hard time early in my career with Java and threads. Didn’t feel like the right answer to distributing tasks.

## Using cores

How could I get cores to do work, without going crazy?
